## Hypervisor
A hypervisor is a software layer that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). It alllows multiple operating systems to share a single physical hardware host by abstracting and partitioning the host's resources (CPU, memory, storage) among the VMs.

Types:
 - Type 1 (bare metal): runs directly on hardware
 - Type 2 (hosted): runs as an application on an existing OS

For this project I will be using VirtualBox as my hypervisor.
It is a type 2 hypervisor because it is easy to install and straight forward to use.

First step is to create a NAT network in VirtualBox. This will allow me to connect all my virtual machines to the same network and to set the Active Directory machine as the gateway to the rest of the Internet.
